Inputs: Carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air enters through stomata, water (H2O) is absorbed by roots, and sunlight provides energy captured by chlorophyll. The process occurs in two main stages: 1) Light-dependent reactions in the thylakoids convert light energy to ATP and NADPH while splitting water and releasing oxygen. 2) Light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) in the stroma use ATP, NADPH, and CO2 to produce glucose. Outputs: Glucose (C6H12O6) serves as food for the plant, and oxygen (O2) is released as a byproduct. The overall equation is: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2.\";\n \nconst result = await scorer.run({\n  input: [{ role: 'user', content: query }],\n  output: { text: response },\n});\n \nconsole.log(result);`;\n"]}
